# Javascript Reading Observations 
# Diego Brown
## 3 observations I did know
1. I was taught in a prior class how binary systems worked, so I knew the way a base 2 represented different values. (also modulo finds you the remainder!)
2. I knew the concept of binding and binding terms, attatching definitions to certain "variables" allows them to be used in operations, these definitions can be changed and each binding can have multiple definitions based upon the situation that is needed. Unless its const then it never changes. 
3. function(){}; I remember when I first tried to learn Javascript a long time ago, when var was used, I learned through learning how to use arithmetic to change data, since in that situation I remember it being used to animate basic art. Once parameters were also shown to be defined it was nice to see little blocks of code written similarly to how I learned it.

## 3 Observations I did not Know
1. I did not realize that automatic type conversion was so baked into Javascript, and how convenient that is, as It allows for more understandable code, at the cost that if used too lax, it will most likelye result in a NaN error
2. I realised over this chapter highlighting mostly syntax and how to do basic commands, that there are multiple ways to do the same things, multiple shortcuts, multiple ways to organize the longer way to do it, I did not realize there were so many commands created for similar effects. I did not realize how situational some commands could be, which is really cool to observe.
3. Functions created for their values are usually much easier to work with than those created for their side effects. Logically it makes sense since while we are designing a chain of functions since pure functions are more effective in changing/organizing data, wheras side effects are usually used in ways that help us as people interface with the computer.
